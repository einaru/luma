			This version features a new logger, which is available from the program menu. It shows general information about LDAP operations, debugging messages and programming errors. This has the benefit that users are not confused any more about messages in the console. If a programming error or any other exceptional event occured, Luma doesn't have to be restarted in the console again, in order to get a backtrace for the developers. A bomb icon will be displayed in the lower right corner, to indicate a error. Clicking on it will open the logger.<br>
			Translations have been updated and we're happy to announce that french has been added. Luma is available in 9 languages now.<br>
			Additionaly Luma has a new logo, created by Rebekka Golombek. It's used as the application icon and is present on the Luma homepage.<br><br>

			<STRONG>Luma 2.0 Released</STRONG><br>
			The Luma Project is proud to announces the availability of Luma 2.0. This release is a major milestone in making Luma even more userfriendly and powerful, for users and developers alike. 
End users will be pleased to hear that an advanced schema browser has been integrated and thanks to it's caching, it's very fast to use. Objectclasses and Attributes are inter-connected, allowing easy browsing between them. Search filters help the user in finding the desired information instantly.<br>
			New dialogs for deleting and exporting LDAP entries have been added. The user has complete control over what will be deleted/exported and gets useful information in case of failure. Additional to LDIF, Luma added support for exporting entries to DSML (a XML based format for storing directory information).<br>
			The LDAP browser has a new look when browsing entries in the tree. Items with lots of attributes and values are displayed much faster now. Additionaly the components got 'smarter' and prevent the users from many common errors. Schema handling has been vastly improved and the user isn't able any more to edit an attribute if it's the relative distinguished name of the entry.<br>
			In the case of failure during a LDAP operation, the user gets an error dialog, displaying the reason. It is no longer necessary to restart Luma in the console and try to reproduce the error.<br>
			Updated translations for English, German, Russian and Swedish are available.<br><br>

			<STRONG>Luma 1.6 Released</STRONG><br>
			The Luma Project is proud to announces the availability of Luma 1.6. This release includes several new features which improve the user experience and make LDAP data management even more easy.<br>
			Support for multiple base DNs per server has been added and incorporated into all Luma components. The user can decide if the base DNs provided by the server should be used, or he can use his own values.<br>
			Luma is able to resolve alias objects and presents these entries in an intuitive way now. Global alias handling can be defined for each server and changed during runtime in the browser. <br>
			One common source of errors by the user is the combination of objectclasses which are structural, but may not belong to the same objectclass chain. Luma checks the schema information of the server and ensures that this error isn't possible any more, saving the user lots of nerves and time. <br>
			Schema caching has been added to improve the general performance of all plugins. Before that each plugin fetched the schemas for all used servers. Especially users on slow networks will notice the speed difference.<br>
			Updated translations for English, German, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish are available.<br><br>
